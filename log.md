# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Began planning/organizing a Wikipedia Viewer for freeCodeCamp. Found the API information I need.

**Thoughts:** I think I understand APIs a lot more since creating a weather app. Hopefully I can apply that knowledge with a different API.

### Day 2: April 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: In Wikipedia Viewer, I am now able to click on a button and get a random Wikipedia article. Trying to figure out how to set up the API to search Wikipedia articles and see the resulting entries. I think (hope) I'm on the right track!

**Thoughts**: I hope I am starting to "think more like a programmer". I am trying to spend more time planning and thinking things out. I definitely spend a fair amount of time searching for answers as well.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
