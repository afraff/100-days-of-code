# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Began planning/organizing a Wikipedia Viewer for freeCodeCamp. Found the API information I need.

**Thoughts:** I think I understand APIs a lot more since creating a weather app. Hopefully I can apply that knowledge with a different API.

**Link to work:** [Wikipedia Viewer](https://codepen.io/afraff/pen/gzbxOR)

### Day 2: April 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: In Wikipedia Viewer, I am now able to click on a button and get a random Wikipedia article. Trying to figure out how to set up the API to search Wikipedia articles and see the resulting entries. I think (hope) I'm on the right track!

**Thoughts**: I hope I am starting to "think more like a programmer". I am trying to spend more time planning and thinking things out. I definitely spend a fair amount of time searching for answers as well.

### Day 3: April 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 #100DaysOfCode - Continued my Wikipedia Viewer for @freeCodeCamp today! An array of information comes back when I click search and that is truly a reason to rejoice for me ;-) The following YouTube video filled in some gaps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7zRKUz-G3s

**Thoughts** It's nice to end on a successful note!

### Day 4: April 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 4 #100DaysOfCode - I was able to spend some extra time today coding and the JavaScript is working in my Wikipedia Viewer! The last thing I worked on was getting rid of undefined search results. Took me over an hour to figure out for one teeny line of code- if (data[1][i] === undefined) {break;} - basically if there is nothing in the data, then break out of the for loop and stop populating the results list. Pretty simple but so happy I was able to figure out a solution.

**Thoughts** short term goals- 1) Try to better think like a programmer by being able to explain the problem (understand), plan the problem out, divide it up into manageable chunks, when stuck (debug, research, maybe even restart), and practice. 2)Learn more about jquery and AJAX calls.

### Day 5: April 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 5 #100DaysOfCode -Tweaking CSS on the Wikipedia Viewer. It works but just trying to make it look better.

**Thoughts** When should I stop fiddling with a project?

### Day 6: April 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 6 #100DaysOfCode -Turned in my Wikipedia Viewer! I also skimmed through the front end developer handbook written by Cody Lindley.

**Thoughts** I love how many tools there are out there to learn web development but it's also overwhelming. It's hard to know what to focus on with so many choices. Another thought today, I want to make sure my time is scheduled as such that I can completely be focused on coding, or completely focused on family time, etc.

### Day 7: April 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 10 #100DaysOfCode - Started looking and researching the next @freecodecamp project, using the Twitchtv JSON API. I am having a harder time understanding this project but hopefully as I keep organizing it will come together.
