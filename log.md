# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Began planning/organizing a Wikipedia Viewer for freeCodeCamp. Found the API information I need.

**Thoughts:** I think I understand APIs a lot more since creating a weather app. Hopefully I can apply that knowledge with a different API.

### Day 2: April 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: In Wikipedia Viewer, I am now able to click on a button and get a random Wikipedia article. Trying to figure out how to set up the API to search Wikipedia articles and see the resulting entries. I think (hope) I'm on the right track!

**Thoughts**: I hope I am starting to "think more like a programmer". I am trying to spend more time planning and thinking things out. I definitely spend a fair amount of time searching for answers as well.

### Day 3: April 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 #100DaysOfCode - Continued my Wikipedia Viewer for @freeCodeCamp today! An array of information comes back when I click search and that is truly a reason to rejoice for me ;-) The following YouTube video filled in some gaps https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7zRKUz-G3s

**Thoughts** It's nice to end on a successful note!
